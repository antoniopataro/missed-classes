# Missed Classes 📚

This is an app meant for you to count how many classes you've missed so far on your current academic period. Also my first React Native project.

Sometimes we gotta skip some classes for personal reasons, to take some resting time or even to study something else. However, I find it hard sometimes to keep track of how many classes I skipped and of how many I can skip.

This is why I've created it.

# Technologies ⚙️

This is my first React Native project, in which I also used Typescript and Styled Components.

Added UUID for unique IDs for classes and AsyncStorage to persist information even after the app has been closed.

Overall, found it easy to deal with React Native, since I'm already familiar with ReactJS.
